# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Current Application Summary

## user_problem_statement: 
The user provided a comprehensive timeline of events from the Democratic Sim Wiki (continuation request) containing 31 documented political events from January 2025 to July 2025. The current application is a sophisticated React + FastAPI + MongoDB timeline application that displays these events in an interactive, filterable interface.

## Current Application Status:
- **Frontend**: ✅ Fully functional React application with beautiful UI
- **Backend**: ✅ Running FastAPI server with MongoDB integration
- **Database**: ✅ MongoDB connected and operational
- **UI Features**: ✅ Advanced filtering, search, event details, statistics dashboard
- **Data**: ✅ All 31 events from Democratic Sim Wiki loaded in frontend

## Current Architecture:
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components, React Router
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Motor (async MongoDB driver)
- **Database**: MongoDB with test_database
- **Data Source**: Currently using mock data in frontend (mockEvents.js)

## Identified Improvement Opportunities:
1. **Backend Integration**: Frontend uses mock data instead of connecting to backend
2. **Database Population**: Event data not stored in MongoDB yet
3. **API Endpoints**: Need endpoints for events, parties, categories
4. **Real-time Features**: Could add real-time updates, user interactions
5. **Additional Features**: Could add bookmarking, sharing, comments, etc.

Added incredible Discord admin drama where Jake (admin) bans Toast (server owner) at 11:46 PM, preventing server deletion by 1 minute. Toast then has epic meltdown in Jake's DMs with 50+ messages over 3 hours, ranging from ALL CAPS rage to desperate pleading. Jake never responds. Server survives in administrative limbo with Jake as sole admin. Peak Discord drama achieved - this is the most authentic Discord server conflict ending possible."

Toast creates alt 'Pollibee#7834' using VPN, rejoins as fake newcomer asking 'hey everyone, new here, this seems like a cool political sim!' Ultimate irony: server founder must pretend to learn about his own creation while watching it decay. Can't reveal identity or faces IP ban. Must watch others explain his constitution to him and respond with 'sounds good!' while internally screaming. Complete fall from grace - god of digital democracy becomes its most powerless citizen.

He expresses horror at how his educational political simulation became 'a murder simulator' with detailed execution scenes. Toast reveals he tried to delete the server because people enjoyed writing about virtual violence - 6 presidential assassinations plus hanging of Noah Jay Sweet and Nepotism. The confession ends the Pollibee deception and starts server-wide reckoning about the line between political roleplay and virtual violence. Total events now 39, high significance 29."

He details each death method: Blight (sniper), Medieval (car bomb), Angstrom (poison), Toast (staged accident), Junk_Trash (drone strike), Veternitzz (sniper), Noah Jay Sweet (hanging). Average presidential term before death: 26 days. Toast declares presidency 'not a position of honor but a death trap' and 'presidential death lottery where house always wins.'

YOU HAD THE POWER TO STOP THE ASSASSINATION ROLEPLAY! BUT YOU CHOSE TO BAN THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY CARED!' Toast rages for over an hour, calling Jake 'enabler not admin', 'spectator not moderator', 'coward and failure.' Final accusation: 'THIS SERVER'S BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS JAKE! EVERY PRESIDENTIAL DEATH! EVERY EXECUTION SCENE! YOU ENABLED ALL OF IT!' Jake maintains characteristic silence throughout founder's complete breakdown. Total events now 41, high significance 31."

Just 4 hours after raging at Jake, Toast admits complete hypocrisy: 'I actually LOVED the Sweet and Nepotism hanging. I thought it was brilliant.' Confesses he was 'genuinely entertained' by all presidential assassinations, calling them 'compelling drama' and 'incredible storytelling.' Admits he wasn't horrified by violence but 'secretly proud,' wasn't disgusted by executions but 'impressed by creativity.' Most damning: 'I didn't try to delete the server because I was disgusted - I was JEALOUS that others wrote better political drama than I could.' Apologizes to Jake, calling hanging 'greatest moment in server history.' Complete 180-degree reversal reveals all moral outrage was fabricated. Total events now 42, high significance 32."

Complete psychological collapse: 'I'M GOING INSANE AND I CAN'T STOP LYING TO YOU ALL AND TO MYSELF.' Admits he's 'COMPLETELY BROKEN' and keeps 'SWITCHING BETWEEN HATING IT AND PRETENDING TO LOVE IT.' Rages at Jake for 2+ hours: 'YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ME HAVE A COMPLETE MENTAL BREAKDOWN FOR DAYS AND YOU'VE SAID NOTHING!' Most desperate: 'I'VE CONTRADICTED MYSELF SO MANY TIMES I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE ANYMORE!'

After Toast's complete psychological breakdown calling him 'sociopathic monster conducting psychological experiments,' Jake breaks silence with most tone-deaf response in Discord history: 'Anybody want to play roblox?' Posted exactly 2 hours 32 minutes after Toast's mental collapse. Server falls into 17-minute shocked silence processing the casual dismissal. Toast goes silent for 6 hours (longest since saga began). Other members confused: 'Jake... did you see Toast's messages?' Jake ignores all reactions, organizes Roblox session at 3 PM while founder has mental health crisis. Response becomes legendary example of 'artistic cruelty' - more devastating than any insult. Toast calls it 'most perfectly executed psychological torture I've ever experienced.'

Jake executed by 'Toast's Avengers' 31 hours after his Roblox response, hanged in same central square as Sweet/Nepotism. Group's manifesto: 'Jake committed crimes against the human spirit' for psychological torture of Toast. Jake maintains silence even during execution, final act is typing 'gg no re' before death. First admin executed in server history, first to remain silent during own execution. Toast responds: 'I never wanted this... Jake was cruel, but he didn't deserve to die.' With Jake's death, server falls into complete administrative chaos - no owner (Toast banned), no admin (Jake dead). Toast's Avengers declare themselves new authority. Jake's psychological warfare dies with him, replaced by raw violence. Total events now 46, high significance 36. Complete collapse of remaining order in Democratic Simulation."
